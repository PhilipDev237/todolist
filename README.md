APP Description:

The TODO list app is a web application that enables users to keep notes of their objectives.
On this app, the user can save as many notes as they like and get back to them anytime because
the data is stored on the MongoDB database. 

I use the Mongoose Library to connect with the MongoDB database and carry out CRUD operations.
Each page is built as a template using EJS library and the code runs on NodeJS server.

USAGE:

- Go to the master branch
- Download the zip file
- Unzip the file and navigate to the file location in your command prompt
- Run npm install to download the required dependencies
- Run your MongoDB database
- Copy your DB  url
- In the app.js file, change "YOUR_MONGODB_DB_URL" to your MongoDB URL
- Type nodemon app.js in the command line to run the app
- Test the site
- Voila!
